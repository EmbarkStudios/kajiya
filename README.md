Its general goal is to get as close as possible to path-traced reference at real-time rates in dynamic scenes, without any precomputed light transport, or manually placed light probes.

`kajiya` does not currently aim to be a fully-featured renderer used to ship games, support all sorts of scenes, lighting phenomena, or a wide range of hardware. It's a hobby project, takes a lot of shortcuts, and is perpetually a work in progress.

For more context, check out our [announcement article on Embark's Medium](https://medium.com/embarkstudios/homegrown-rendering-with-rust-1e39068e56a7). You'll also get to learn how `kajiya` connects to our rendering work, and the [`rust-gpu`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu) project!

## Features

* Hybrid rendering using a mixture of raster, compute, and ray-tracing
* Dynamic global illumination
  * Fully dynamic geometry and lighting without precomputation
  * Volumetric temporally-recurrent irradiance cache for "infinite" bounces
  * Ray-traced diffuse final gather for high-frequency details
  * Ray-traced specular, falling back to diffuse after the first hit
* Sun with ray-traced soft shadows
* Standard PBR with GGX and roughness/metalness
  * Energy-preserving multi-scattering BRDF
* Reference path-tracing mode
* Temporal super-resolution and anti-aliasing
* Natural tone mapping
* Physically-based glare
* Basic motion blur
* Contrast-adaptive sharpening
* Optional DLSS support
* glTF mesh loading (no animations yet)
* A render graph running it all

## Technical details

* [Global illumination overview](docs/gi-overview.md)
* Repository highlights:
  * HLSL shaders: [`assets/shaders/`](assets/shaders)
  * Rust shaders: [`crates/lib/rust-shaders/`](crates/lib/rust-shaders)
  * Main render graph passes: [`world_render_passes.rs`](crates/lib/kajiya/src/world_render_passes.rs)

## Primary platforms

`kajiya` currently works on a limited range of operating systems and hardware.

Hardware:

* Nvidia RTX series
* Nvidia GTX 1060 and newer _with 6+ GB of VRAM_ (slow: driver-emulated ray-tracing)
* AMD Radeon RX 6000 series

Operating systems:

* Windows
* Linux

## Secondary Platforms

`kajiya` has a rudimentary "RTX Off" mode which runs on a wider range of systems, but most of its visual features are disabled.

Hardware:

* Older GPUs with support for Vulkan 1.2

Operating systems:

* macOS

## Dependencies

### (Some) Linux dependencies

* `uuid-dev`
* In case the bundled `libdxcompiler.so` doesn't work: <https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler#downloads>

### (Some) MacOS dependencies

* `ossp-uuid` (`brew install ossp-uuid`)

## Building and running

To build `kajiya` [you need Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once Rust is installed, open a command prompt in the project folder, then build and run the viewer app via:

```
cargo run --bin view --release
```

This will compile a binary in the `target/release` folder, and then run it.

For a list of supported command-line switches see `--help`. In order to pass it through `cargo` to the renderer, you need to separate the `cargo` arguments from `view` arguments using `--` e.g.:

```
cargo run --bin view --release -- --help
```

## Loading assets

`kajiya` supports meshes in the [glTF 2.0](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF) format, and also has its own tiny [RON](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron)-based scene format which can refer to multiple glTF 2.0 meshes.

To load either, simply drag-n-drop the `.gltf`, `.glb`, or `.ron` file onto the window of the `view` app. See the `assets/` folder for a few bundled examples.

The first time a mesh is loaded, it is converted to a runtime format: the vertices are packed, and textures are compressed. The next time the same mesh is used, it's loaded from the `cache/` folder.

Please note that only the roughness-metalness workflow in glTF is supported. In Blender that corresponds to _Principled BSDF_.

`kajiya` can also load image-based lights ([examples](http://www.hdrlabs.com/sibl/archive.html)). To do so, drag-n-drop an `.exr` or `.hdr` file onto window of the `view` app.

The loaded assets can be manipulated in the `Scene` section of the UI. The app state is persisted in `view_state.ron`.

## Controls in the `view` app

* WSAD, QE - movement
* Mouse + RMB - rotate the camera
* Mouse + LMB - rotate the sun
* Shift - move faster
* Ctrl - move slower
* Space - switch to reference path tracing
* Tab - show/hide the UI

## Resolution scaling

### DPI

For the `view` app, DPI scaling in the operating system affects the physical number of pixels of the rendering output. The `--width` and `--height` parameters correspond to _logical_ window size **and** the internal rendering resolution. Suppose the OS uses DPI scaling of `1.5`, and the app is launched with `--width 1000`, the actual physical width of the window will be `1500` px. Rendering will still happen at `1000` px, with upscaling to `1500` px at the very end, via a Catmull-Rom kernel.

### Temporal upsampling

`kajiya` can also render at a reduced internal resolution, and reconstruct a larger image via temporal upsampling, trading quality for performance. A custom temporal super-resolution algorithm is used by default, and [DLSS is supported](docs/using-dlss.md) on some platforms. Both approaches result in better quality than what could be achieved by simply spatially scaling up the image at the end.

For example, `--width 1920 --height 1080 --temporal-upsampling 1.5` will produce a `1920x1080` image by upsampling by a factor of `1.5` from `1280x720`. Most of the rendering will then happen with `1.5 * 1.5 = 2.25` times fewer pixels, resulting in an _almost_ 2x speedup.

## Known issues

* Vulkan API usage is extremely basic. Resources are usually not released, and barriers aren't optimal.
* There are hard limit on mesh data and instance counts. Exceeding those limits will result in panics and Vulkan validation errors / driver crashes.
* Window (framebuffer) resizing is not yet implemented.
* Denoising needs more work (always).
